## This folder contains the .sch and .brd files for producing the custom printed circuit board (PCB)

You can upload these to any board fabrication house, or if you want to use OshPark you can click this link to buy it directly (we are not compensated if you use OshPark BTW, but we like their service and provide this link for convenience):<br>
